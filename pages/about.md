## About the Collection

<center>Arbor Garden photographed for Country Gardens magazine</center>

This digital collection features perennials, roses, annuals, herbs, and tomatoes that thrive in my Zone 5 garden in central Iowa where sweltering summers and frigid winters create a challenging climate for plants. All the featured plants were selected to complement the style of my 1885 Victorian home. The photos were taken by me between 2017 and 2023. I own the copyright.
